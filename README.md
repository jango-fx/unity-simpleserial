# SimpleSerial for Unity

basic serial communication for Unity.

developed in combination with ***SimpleSerialVS*** to enable serial communication with Unity's VisualScripting.
 
makes heavy use of [Antanas Veiverys EnhancedSerialPort](https://antanas.veiverys.com/mono-serialport-datareceived-event-workaround-using-a-derived-class/) due to .Net's Serialport.DataReceived callback not with Mono.
